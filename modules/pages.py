    ## **How It's Built**

    Stockastic is built with these core frameworks and modules:

    - **Streamlit** - To create the web app UI and interactivity 
    - **Scikit Learn** - To build the ARIMA time series forecasting model
    - **Quandil** - To fetch financial data
    - **seaborn and matplotlib** - To create interactive financial charts

    The app workflow is:

    1. User selects a stock ticker
    2. Historical data is fetched with Quandil
    3. Linear regression model is trained on the data 
    4. Model makes price forecasts absed on the parameters user provide
    5. Results are plotted with matplotlib and seaborn

        Using a public API provided by [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/), the application fetches historical stock data based on the selected stock symbol and date range.
                 
        ```python
        @st.cache_data()

        st.write('''
            The accuracy of the predictions is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score metrics. MSE measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values, while R2 score indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (stock price) that is predictable from the independent variables (features). The evaluation results are displayed in the application.

        st.write('''
            Yes, you can customize the input values for prediction using sliders provided in the "Predictions" section of the application. Simply adjust the sliders for features such as Open, High, Low, Last, Total Trade Quantity, and Turnover (Lacs) to input the desired future values for prediction.
